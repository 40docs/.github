The **40docs platform** is a comprehensive multi-repository ecosystem that manages 25+ interconnected repositories through Git submodules and automation. It provides a secure, scalable infrastructure for documentation, security labs, and cloud-native applications using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with GitOps workflows.

## üéØ What We Do

**40Docs** demonstrates how organizations can implement **Documentation as Code** with full infrastructure automation, security-first design, and developer experience optimization at enterprise scale.

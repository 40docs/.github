4. **Accelerate Delivery**: Automated testing and validation pipelines

### Success Metrics
- **Availability**: >99.9% uptime (8.7h/year downtime budget)
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities in production containers  
- **Performance**: <30s infrastructure deployment time improvements
- **Quality**: >95% test coverage for infrastructure components

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical High Availability (Week 1-2)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Addresses single point of failure

#### 1.1 FortiWeb High Availability Implementation
```bash
# Files Created:
├── infrastructure/hub-nva-ha-enhanced.tf          # Multi-zone FortiWeb deployment
├── infrastructure/variables-ha-enhanced.tf        # HA configuration variables  
├── infrastructure/cloud-init/fortiweb-ha.conf    # HA cluster configuration
```

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-Zone Deployment**: Primary and secondary FortiWeb instances across zones 1 & 2
- **Load Balancer Integration**: Azure Standard Load Balancer with health probes
- **Automated Failover**: Health checks with 30s intervals, 3-probe threshold
- **Session Persistence**: Source IP protocol-based load distribution
- **Monitoring Integration**: Built-in health alerts and diagnostic settings

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Deploy `hub-nva-ha-enhanced.tf` alongside existing configuration
2. Set `hub_nva_high_availability = true` in terraform.tfvars
3. Run terraform plan/apply to provision HA infrastructure
4. Test failover scenarios and validate health probes
5. Update DNS and application configurations

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime migration
- Rollback plan maintains single-instance configuration
- Comprehensive testing in staging environment first

#### 1.2 Enhanced Variables and Configuration
**New Variables**:
- `hub_nva_high_availability`: Enable/disable HA mode
- `hub_nva_health_check_interval`: Configurable health check timing
- `hub_nva_availability_zones`: Zone selection for deployment
- `hub_nva_instance_size_*`: Environment-specific sizing

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Modernization (Week 3-4)  
**Priority**: HIGH - Improves maintainability and reusability

#### 2.1 Terraform Modularization
```bash
# Module Structure:
infrastructure/modules/
├── network-hub-spoke/          # Network topology module
├── fortiweb-ha/               # HA FortiWeb deployment module
├── aks-cluster/              # AKS cluster configuration module
├── application-deployment/    # Standard app deployment pattern
├── monitoring/               # Observability and alerting
└── certificate-management/   # TLS automation module
```

**Benefits**:
- **Reusability**: Modules work across dev/staging/prod environments
- **Testing**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
- **Maintenance**: Changes isolated to specific components
- **Standards**: Consistent implementation patterns

**Migration Strategy**:
1. Extract network configuration into hub-spoke module
2. Create FortiWeb HA module with enhanced availability  
3. Modularize AKS cluster and application patterns
4. Update main configuration to use modules
5. Validate against existing infrastructure

#### 2.2 Enhanced Testing Framework
```bash
# Testing Structure:
infrastructure/test/

- **Cost Alerts**: Budget monitoring with spending thresholds

#### 3.2 Security and Performance Metrics
**Key Performance Indicators**:
- FortiWeb health and failover status
- AKS node utilization and pod restart rates  
- Application response times and error rates
- Network traffic patterns and anomaly detection
- Security event correlation and threat analysis

### Phase 4: Container Security Hardening (Week 7-8)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Enhances security posture

#### 4.1 Optimized Container Builds
```bash
# Container Security Files:
├── mkdocs/Dockerfile.optimized           # Multi-stage secure build
├── .dockerignore.enhanced               # Optimized build context
└── container-security-scan.sh          # Comprehensive security scanning
```

**Security Enhancements**:

- **Non-Root User**: Runtime security with dedicated mkdocs user (UID 1000)
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Separate build and runtime stages
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy, Grype, Syft integration for vulnerability detection
- **Build Context Optimization**: Reduced image size and faster builds
